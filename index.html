        <h3>Why flowers so important to our plants</h3>
        <p>
          What is the importance of flowers in our life? Flowers not only add
          color, texture, and biodiversity to gardens and environments, they are
          also an important structure for plants and an essential food source
          for many organisms. <br />
          Flowers are an important means of attracting pollen substances to
          plants, and plants need to produce seeds, the reproductive structures
          that allow seeds to exist for generations. <br />
          Flowers can also protect growing seeds and successfully pass genetic
          material to the next generation. <br />
          Flowering plants are called angiosperms and are a group that has
          evolved to include a variety of sizes, shapes, and colours.
